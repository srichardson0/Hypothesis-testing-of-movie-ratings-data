# Hypothesis-testing-of-movie-ratings-data
 In this project, I demonstrate the essential skills involved in hypothesis testing. To do so, I will use a real dataset that stems from a replication attempt of published research (Wallisch &amp; Whritner, 2017).   I pretend I am working for a major movie studio that needs to answer these questions in order to optimize their operations. I use figures as needed to buttress/illustrate my argument.  To cut down on false positives, set the per-test significance level ùõº to 0.005 (as per Benjamin et al., 2018).
